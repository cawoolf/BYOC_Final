************UI/UX Notes*****************************************************************************

Currency option!!

Card View animation for rearrange and organizing converters.

Update UI for HomeSet that hides Converter UI until card is clicked.
Long click for delete converter card.. Displays a little x to delete.


Remove swap button, center info button on converter card view

Use Firebase?

But add currency option for sure. Demonstrats alot.

Add currency conversion
    > Utilize back end online server and the Repository.

Throw an ad banner down there on HomeSet and SetList!

CB's load data into the Converter XML when clicked.
CXML UI allow the user to run conversions.

In the Home Set, Just copy Converter Bee by using little cards to save and load data into the converter.

In the Set List, create useful sets of Converters, that you can save as a link/ card that shows up
on the Home Set! That makes it a little different than Converter Bee.
    > Automotive
    > Finance
    > USA to Europe
    > Chemistry
The a list from the Set List can be saved to the Home Set as it's own CB

Selecting a set from the Set List will load it's own activity
    > Basically just a pre-populated version of the Home Set

When you long click a Converter Box (CB), you can move it over to add it to a set.
    > When you expand a set, it blows up to take over the home screen with all the units that
    are stored inside of it.
    > On Set List screen, each set has a little Add next to it. When clicked it adds a card to the home
    screen, which can be expanded on click to show all the units in that set.

App should always load onto the Home screen after cards have been added to it.

Two little blue lines on the scroll view that snap the units into place, and load them to the converter.
    > I think recycle view might be better for this?

> Add a custom keyboard with a clear button, like a calculator
> Make Main activity wrench and add button visibility gone when edit text is clicked

************BackEnd Notes***************************************************************************

Big question.. is initializing multiple instances of ViewModel to access the Repository and hence the
database really the best way to do it? Would prefer to just have like one static all accessible View
Model that the whole app can use.. But is that the right way for real too??

ViewModel Singleton?
Actually better to have a repository and database singleton.. Which we do in this case for the db.

> Actually not as big of a deal as I thought.. Each ViewModel is unique to the Activity
Which is this case is only the main activity, so calling it a handfu of times
Does'nt really create a memory leak?

Use MVVM and Room Database Extensively!

> MySet is the home set of converters
> In SetList, the selection of a list loads that converter set directly on to the SetList fragment.
> Design app as best as possible with MVVM in mind

> Fragments and Activities just control the UI
        > Relay the user inputs to the ViewModel
    > The ViewModel (Each Fragment has one) and handles the data
        > Passes that down to a Repository
            > Which Stores it into room


> Use JSON to initialize the Room database

************Specifics*******************************************************************************
Fragments must handle menu stuff with tab navigation.

Themes are applied at the activity level in the manifest.

Can select from Android material colors list. There's alot.

SpinnerBug: Fixed
    > Clears SavedInstance and Always initializes the Spinner through the ConverterTab constructor.
To fix Spinner performance, need to use nested fragments.
    > getChildFramgent manager.
It's not really a bug.. It's initializing the fragment before you scroll to it for performance.

ConverterTabFrag constructor trying to initialize the SpinnerScrollViewFragment from onCreate savedInstanceState!

AsyncTask UI Thread bug for getTargetConverter()

    ConverterTab UI
        > Loop fixed, but conversion rate not changing after new units selected
            > Focus hasn't changed yet.. so the textWatcher aren't triggered, which allows for the unit
                conversion to run.
        > unitA is not being focused by default.

        > Create converter logic for the Spinner.
            > Link SpinnerScrollViewFragment >> ConverterTabFragment >> Add Button on MainActivity
            > Create it so the spinner menu highlights the unit selection.
            > Fragments implementing other fragment stuff.. I dunno I guess we'll figure it out lol
            > The Spinner is currently its own Fragment.. That does'nt seem to be needed.
            > Apparently that might be the best way to do this.. Kind of makes sense. But

1. Fill out and add more converter data to SpinnerFragment.
Lots of SQL work to be done. Implement favorites.

Just need multiple tables for each unit type, and a favorites table.
That will make everything much neater and easier to manage.
Actually no because then each table need its own DAO.

Need to add favorites table to SQL for HomeSetTabFrag
    > Not favorites table, favorites column with a 1 or null for a favorite DONE
    > Link add button to favorites table.
    > Have add button take data from spinner fragment
    > Update Delete and Add button..
        > Delete should just get the target converter, and set it's favorite to 0. Otherwise you'd be
        deleting it from the entire database, and the spinner frag won't work.
    > Finish distance data. Atleast for km.. to make testing easier.



Currency Favorites implementation
    > Currency Util talks to Homeset Frag, and Add button.
    > Having a hard time getting that data out of the Retofit call
        > Watching the rest of the tutorials on RetroFit, and Threads on CodingInFlow
        > Looper, Handlers, and so to get the data out.
    > Actually caching is what i need to do.. Cache from retrofit.

Plan now is to just create a separate room database for the currency objects. Or maybe not.
Could probably just use the same database.

There can be several tables in Room?
