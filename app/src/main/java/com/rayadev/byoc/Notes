****General Notes for BYOC****



Working: Copy TabExperiment and redo fragments + adapter.



> MySet is the home set of converters
> In SetList, the selection of a list loads that converter set directly on to the SetList fragment.
> Design app as best as possible with MVVM in mind

> Fragments and Activities just control the UI
    > The ViewModel (Each Fragment has one) and handles the data
        > Passes that down to a Repository
            > Which Stores it into room


Specifics:

SpinnerBug
To fix Spinner performance, need to use nested fragments.
    > getChildFramgent manager.

Also make sure the basic converter layout is a card view.
Fragments must handle menu stuff with tab navigation.


Done:
Fixed options menu by reduing PageAdapter
