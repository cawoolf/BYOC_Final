****General Notes for BYOC****

ToDo:

Finish first draft of UI/UX:
Update Converter card view.
Create Converter/Set cards from Home Screen

************UI/UX Notes*****************************************************************************
In the Home Set, Just copy Converter Bee by using little cards to save and load data into the converter.

In the Set List, create useful sets of Converters, that you can save as a link/ card that shows up
on the Home Set! That makes it a little different than Converter Bee.
    > Automotive
    > Finance
    > USA to Europe
    > Chemistry
When you long click a saved converter card, you can move it over to add it to a set.
    > When you expand a set, it blows up to take over the home screen with all the units that
    are stored inside of it.
    > On Set List screen, each set has a little Add next to it. When clicked it adds a card to the home
    screen, which can be expanded on click to show all the units in that set.

App should always load onto the Home screen after cards have been added to it.

Two little blue lines on the scroll view that snap the units into place, and load them to the converter.
    > I think recycle view might be better for this?


************BackEnd Notes***************************************************************************
> MySet is the home set of converters
> In SetList, the selection of a list loads that converter set directly on to the SetList fragment.
> Design app as best as possible with MVVM in mind

> Fragments and Activities just control the UI
    > The ViewModel (Each Fragment has one) and handles the data
        > Passes that down to a Repository
            > Which Stores it into room



************Specifics*******************************************************************************
Fragments must handle menu stuff with tab navigation.

Themes are applied at the activity level in the manifest.

Can select from Android material colors list. There's alot.


************Bugs************************************************************************************
SpinnerBug
To fix Spinner performance, need to use nested fragments.
    > getChildFramgent manager.
It's not really a bug.. It's intilziing the fragment before you scroll to it for performance.

ConverterTabFrag constructor trying to intialize the spinnerfragment from onCreate savedInstanceState!
